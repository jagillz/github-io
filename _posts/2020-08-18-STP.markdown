I found this subject a little challenging at first, but once you have it down it is really not that complicated. Lets start by looking at the objectives of the CCNA exam regarding spanning-tree:

**2.5 Describe the need for and basic operations of Rapid PVST+ Spanning Tree Protocol and identify basic operations**

 * *2.5.a Root port, root bridge (primary/secondary), and other port names*
 * *2.5.b Port states (forwarding/blocking)*
 * *2.5.c PortFast benefits*

 Lets start by quickly looking at why we have spanning-tree. Take the following example below:

![My helpful screenshot](/assets/img/png3.png)

Here we have two switches interconnected with 2 ethernet links. Lets look at how looping occurs in this topology:

1. Host A requests the MAC address of Host B, and sends out an ARP request.
2. Switch A will forward out the frames from both its interface to Switch B
3. Switch B will forward the frame on every interface (by definition a broadcast) except the interface in which the frame was received on.
4. Switch B will forward the frame back to Switch A on the redundant link, and vice versa. As a consequence, both the switches will keep forwarding frames between each other, creating a looping of frames.


## Spanning-tree solves this problem - how? 

Spanning-tree helps us by blocking certain interfaces using a set of metrics to decide which ports to block and which to forward. As a result we can have multiple redundant links and not have to worry about looping.
STP uses **bridge protocol data units** to communicate between the switches (known as BPDUs).

Using these frames, the switches elect how the STP topology will look by:

1. Electing a "master" - also called **root bridge** - based on certain terms
2. Choosing which interfaces to block and which interfaces to forward

The root bridge is elected by looking at information in the BPDUs - containing **mac address** and **priority**. Combining these two a bridge ID is formed - the lowest wins. We can change this manually by setting the priority:

<pre><code>Jasmeet(config)#spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 
</code></pre>

After the root root bridge election is done, STP places all the ports here as **designated** (this means forwarding). Now the confusing part, what about rest of the switches and how are the ports determined?

First defining ports (important!)

1. **Root Port**: Lowest path cost to our root bridge. Bandwidth is used as a metric in case of multiple paths to root bridge (checking bandwidth of each link). Higher is better. The lowest cost port (highest bandwidth) is elected as a root port. 
2. **Designated port**: One designated port per segment, lowest cost to get on a given network compared to other ports on that segment
3. **Non-designated port**: Put in a **blocking** state, non-root / non-designated ports. Higher cost.

  | Bandwidth | Cost |
  |-----------|------| 
  | 10 mbit: | 100  |
  | 100 mbit:  | 19   |
  | 1000 mbit: | 4    |


Lets look at this through an example:
